## Weather Twins Project - Large Scale Data Engineering 2016
For the course Large Scala Data Engineering (2016) we (me and Matteo Maria Fiore) created a tool to visualize Weather Twins. That is, the goal was to find locations on planet Earth that share similar weather conditions.
To find these locations, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) was made available on a Hadoop cluster. We analyzed this data using Apache Spark, and visualized the results in an interactive web tool.

The report that we wrote for this project can be found here: https://event.cwi.nl/lsde/2016/group2.pdf
